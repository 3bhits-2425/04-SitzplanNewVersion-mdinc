# This Project is about displaying the classroom of the class 3BHITS identically.
# We created prefabs for table and two chairs.
# Not only that, we also created different scenes were you canl play and stop audios.
# To make the updating easier everyone has their own repository with their project on GitHub.
# To create the correct amount of tables and chairs we made a script with a loop
